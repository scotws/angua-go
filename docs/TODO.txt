TODO file for Angua
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 16. Mar 2018
This version: 09. Nov 2018

------------------
FIRST, get one CPU (emulated) set up and running

- Remove XO again, instead, have goroutine "Switcher" running as part of
  angua that handles cpu8 <-> cpu16 switches

- Get a basic routine running in cpu8.Run() so that it runs while
  waiting for input

- Rewrite mem with common, make things RW threadsafe, move conversion to
  little endian to common routines; make methods to chuck and memory
  pointers

NEAR GOAL: Tali Forth 2 must run on the emulated version without a hitch
FAR GOAL: Tali Forth 2 must be able to run tests on the emulated version

------------------
NEXT, get the CPU16 (native) to work

NEAR GOAL: Get Liara Forth to run on the native version
