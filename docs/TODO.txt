TODO file for Angua
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 16. Mar 2018
This version: 03. Feb 2019 (Superbowl LIII)

NEXT UP:

- Generalize LDA routine in cpu/helpers.go
- Move lda.# to generalized routine
- Add lda.l
- Generalize STA routine in cpu/helpers.go
- Add sta.l
- Add I/O so that we can access through nc
- Add SET TRACE ON, SET TRACE OFF so we have the option to print 

- Create a lot more test routines for mem (incl read across chunk boundries)
- Add SET STEP ON, SET STEP OFF, test CPU main loop
- Add SET VERBOSE ON, SET VERBOSE OFF so we have the option to print 
  diagnostic information
- IRQ, NMI, etc need parameter "run" if one-shot and "repeat <N> sec" for
  repeats"
- breakpoint gets format "breakpoint <ADDR> <ACTION>" where action can be "IRQ",
  "NMI", "HALT", "STATUS", "CLEAR" (removes that BP), and "SHOW" (prints all bp). 
  Synonym is "bp". 

FAR GOALS: 

- NATIVE: Get Liara Forth to run on the native version
