TODO file for Angua

First version: 16. Mar 2018
This version: 15. Jan 2019

NEXT UP:

- Add special write address SLEEP for testing
- Add code for interrupts NMI in own file cpu/interrupts.go
- Test nmi command
- Expand to periodic interrupts ("nmi repeat <N> sec")
- Add fake code to sta, lda, and sta.d so we can start special I/O system
- Add I/O so that we can access through nc
- Create a lot more test routines for mem (incl read across chunk boundries)
- Add SET STEP ON, SET STEP OFF, test CPU main loop
- Add SET VERBOSE ON, SET VERBOSE OFF so we have the option to print 
- Add SET TRACE ON, SET TRACE OFF so we have the option to print 
  diagnostic information

- Add special write addres for DELAY which waits for 0.1 sec * cpu.A, use this
  for experiments with loops
- IRQ, NMI, etc need parameter "run" if one-shot and "repeat <N> sec" for
  repeats"
- breakpoint gets format "breakpoint <ADDR> <ACTION>" where action can be "IRQ",
  "NMI", "HALT", "STATUS", "CLEAR" (removes that BP), and "SHOW" (prints all bp). 
  Synonym is "bp". 

FAR GOALS: 

- NATIVE: Get Liara Forth to run on the native version
