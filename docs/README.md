# Documentation for Angua
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

Angua's documentation is written in AsciiDoc and compiled to a main HTML
file with `asciidoctor -a toc=left manual.adoc`. In future versions, there will
be a PDF document.

This folder looks messier than it is -- what you are probably looking for is the
the `manual.html` file.
