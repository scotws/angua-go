This is the original manifesto for the Angua 65816 Emulator. It contains 
the rough ideas about what the project's aims are and structure should look
like, and is superceded by all other documents. It is mainly included for
historical interest.


MOTIVATION

There are currently very few emulators for the 65816. The example of the py65
emulator for the 6502/65c02 shows that a good emulator lowers the barrier to
experimenting with the chip.


WHY GO?

There are two goals we can follow with an emulator of this type: A program that
is actually used instead of hardware, or a tool to develop programs on
hardware. In the first case, speed is a priority, in the second case,
extensive checks and ease of retooling is. 

The Go version of Angua assumes that you will not necessarily be creating your
own 65816 hardware -- the MPU is actually somewhat harder to work with than the
little sisters, the 65c02 and 6502. Therefore, we're assuming that a lot of
people will be using the emulator as a primary way to program the 65816, and
have speed as a priority. 


INTERFACE

Angua is intended to allow both scripting and interactive use.
